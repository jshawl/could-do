This talk will outline the changes we made both technically and culturally to transform not only the security team, but the whole organization into treating security as a design goal rather than an afterthought.</p> <p>You’ll leave this talk with a solid grasp of the tools and techniques needed to knock down the silos around your security team and enter a utopian world of security first engineering.</p> <p>Bio<br/>===<br/>Paul Czarkowski is a recovering Systems Administrator who has run infrastructure for longer than he cares to admit. After cutting his teeth in the ISP and Gaming industries Paul changed his focus to using (and contributing to) Open Source Software to improve the Operability of complex distributed systems such as Kubernetes and OpenStack.

Getting street parking is typically not a problem in the 7:30 - 8:00 range.

Not all of us are fortunate enough to claim a CS degree or enjoy the guidance of a senior.

We want to help.</p> <p>Come for 20 minutes. Come for three hours. Whether you're a new programmer, a veteran exploring a new language, or a tech-adverse soul lost in a sea of WYSIWYG site generators, you're among friends.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Coming as a mentor?

Invite them to a fun, interactive usability benefits quiz -- with a prize!</p> <p>In this talk, Lawrence Najjar will share his popular usability benefits quiz. He will ask multiple-choice questions to engage participants and show just how important ease of use is for products. You write down your choices then he gives the research-based correct answers. Make a copy of the quiz to use where you work.</p> <p>Bio: Lawrence Najjar is an award-winning user experience designer and researcher with extensive experience making the complex simple. He worked at small design consulting firms and large companies on enterprise applications, mobile applications, e-commerce sites, and wearable computers. He has degrees in engineering psychology from Georgia Tech, authored 100 professional papers and publications, and served on the board of the Austin User Experience Professionals Association. His personal website is <a href=\"http://www.lawrence-najjar.com/new-index.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.lawrence-najjar.com/new-index.html</a></p> <p>Pizza and beer will be provided thanks to our sponsor Voltage Control.</p> <p>About this meetup's sponsor:</p> <p>Voltage Control is bringing Jake Knapp back to Austin for a 1-day Design Sprint workshop. In this fun, fast-paced, hands-on workshop, you’ll learn the Design Sprint directly from its creator. Jake will rapidly lead you through the process, teaching how the various steps fit together and why and how they work. You’ll get tips and tricks beyond the Sprint book, and you’ll learn how to incorporate these techniques into normal meetings. Jake will give your team a new way of looking at business challenges and the confidence to approach those challenges with renewed energy and optimism. You'll laugh. You'll high five. You'll learn ridiculously useful skills.</p> <p>Get your tickets today: <a href=\"http://www.ticketbase.com/events/design-sprint-bootcamp-jake-knapp-voltage-control\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ticketbase.com/events/design-sprint-bootcamp-jake-knapp-voltage-control</a></p> <p>Follow Voltage Control:<br/><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/voltagectrl\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.twitter.com/voltagectrl</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/voltagecontrol\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/voltagecontrol</a><br/><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/voltagectrl/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.instagram.com/voltagectrl/</a></p> <p>A very grateful thank you to Rackspace for hosting!</p> ",

      "description": "<p>1) Microstates: The React of State Management</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>When was the last time you had fun working with state?</p> <p>For many, the answer is probably never, because state management in JavaScript is an endless game of compromises. You can choose to go fully immutable and write endless reducers. You can go mutable and everything becomes an observable. Or you can just go with vanilla setState and lose the benefits of serialization and time travel debugging.</p> <p>Unlike the view layer, where most frameworks agree on some variation of React's concept of components, none of the current crop of state management tools strike the same balance that React components introduced to the API.</p> <p>React components have a tiny API. They are functional, simple and extremely reusable. The tiny API gives you high productivity for little necessary knowledge. Functional components are predictable and easy to reason about. They are conceptually simple, but simplicity hides an underlying architecture geared for performance. Their simplicity, predictability and isolation makes them composable and reusable.</p> <p>These factors combined are what make React style components easy to work with and ultimately fun to write. So why doesn’t a similar, tiny API abstracting a sophisticated architecture exist for state management? Why shouldn’t working with state be as easy and intuitive as working with React? We’ll be talking about this very reasonable question, and the vision for what the “react of state management” would look like.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js</a></p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Charles strives to make software that is a delight to use, and a pleasure to maintain.

Culturally, AI is portrayed as being some sentient robotic thing that will take over humanity (lol). Even among engineers, machine learning is seen as a mysterious and endless money-making magical technology that, despite its fame, is generally not well understood by those that aren't skilled in it.</p> <p>Justin Heath- cybersecurity and data science expert- will present a practical and well-grounded introduction to data science and machine learning technologies. After his talk you will be able to distinguish the reality from the hype, and you will gain exposure to the basic tools to help you get started learning more about Data Science.</p> <p>This month we'd like to give a special shout-out and thanks to:</p> <p>GALVANIZE!!!</p> <p>They will be buying the pizza and drinks, and will be answering questions about their great courses that help you get up to speed with Data Science and other topics.</p> <p>We're excited to see you all here!</p> ",

Join us in discussion around solutions for scaling Ethereum for the future.</p> <p>The Ethereum network can process around 1.3 million transactions per day at a rate of 13 tx/s while VisaNet processes 150 million transactions at a rate of 1600 tx/s. How can Ethereum reach global adoption with 1/100th of Visa’s throughput? Blockchain scaling comes with a unique set of problems by the very nature of decentralization. How can Ethereum achieve scalability while remaining secure and decentralized?</p> <p>We’ll be discussing solutions such as sharding, side chains, off-chain computation, and state channels.</p> <p>About the speaker</p> <p>Preston Van Loon, Team Co-Lead @ Prysmatic Labs, Software Engineer @ Google.<br/>Twitter: @preston_vanloon<br/>Email: [masked]</p> <p>Driven by the chance to have an impact on the world, Preston seeks challenges and solutions that can benefit everyone on a global scale. After first learning about Ethereum in early 2017, he began to explore and dive deep into Ethereum protocol. He co-founded Prysmatic Labs in January 2018. Prysmatic Labs has received grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum Community Fund, Aragon Nest, and others to enable implementation of an open source Ethereum Sharding client based on the popular client go-ethereum. He works closely with the Ethereum Research team and other clients to achieve sharding for Ethereum 2.0.</p> ",

If you don't know Chess, don't be intimidated: I or others will be more than willing to teach you, and this is all for fun! If you have a board, pieces, and clock please respond accordingly to the RSVP question, and bring them!</p> <p>If things work out for it and people are interested, we'll play HQ Trivia at 8:00PM!</p> <p>No rules except The Golden Rule, and please honor Bennu's 1 item minimum!</p> <p>Let's have fun, see y'all there!</p> ",
